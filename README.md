# MeetUp-Workshops
Practising data science and machine learning via workshops 


1. Introduction to the Problem: We will begin by understanding the problem at hand and its objectives.
2. Data Preprocessing: We will discuss techniques for cleaning and preparing the data, ensuring its quality and reliability.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will delve into the data through exploratory analysis, uncovering patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
4. Feature Selection and Engineering: We will learn how to select the most relevant features from the data and create new ones to enhance the model's performance.
5. Model Selection: We will explore different machine learning or statistical models suitable for the problem, considering factors such as complexity and interpretability.
6. Model Training and Evaluation: We will cover the process of training the selected model using the prepared dataset and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
7. Model Deployment: We will discuss how to deploy the trained model into a production environment or integrate it into a system for real-world applications.
Throughout the workshop, we will provide hands-on examples and practical insights to guide you through each step of the data science project implementation.
